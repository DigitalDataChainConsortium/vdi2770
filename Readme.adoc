== Project Overview
This project provides a reference implementation of the 
link:https://www.beuth.de/de/technische-regel/vdi-2770-blatt-1/319538792[VDI 2770 specification] 
focusing on the implementation of containers and metadata. 
The validation web service can analyze document container, documentation container as 
well as XML metadata files or PDF files. Validation reports are available as JSON
results or PDF report files.

In a nutshell, VDI 2770 defines technical requirements for digital documentation exchange.

. Every document shall conform to PDF/A-{1,2,3}
. Metadata shall be available for every document
. Metadata shall be provided as an XML file
. Documents and their metadata shall be bundled as ZIP containers (called 
document container)
. The handover documentation shall be zipped as documentation container.

== Building the Source Code
This project is implemented with Java programming language. JDK 17 is required. 

link:https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] is used for dependency management. To build from scratch, call

[source=bash]
----
$ mvn clean package
----

== Module Overview
There are several modules in Spring Boot. Here is a quick overview:

=== vdi2770-core
This project provides functionalities to read and write VDI 2770 XML metadata files. 
This includes basic validation.

=== vdi2770-processor
The processor can "process"a document or a documentation including creating and reading 
containers. It provides extended validation functionalities.

=== vdi2770-validator[-web]
This module provides a web API to validate XML metadate files, document container files,
documentation container files or PDF files.

== Documentation

Each project contains a `documentation.adoc` file in the `src/docs/asciidoc` folder.
These files use the link:https://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] include directive. 
Therefore, these files can not be rendered by github. 
The following command demonstrates the conversion a `documentation.adoc` file to a HTML file.
